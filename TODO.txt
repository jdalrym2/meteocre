NWSTools plan:
- Fetch SPC threats and forecasts
- Parse NWS point forecasts (take from WWS)
- Parse curent NWS alerts (take from WWS)
- Fetch GOES-R imagery
- Fetch weather radar

Data Mining Project:
  - For years 2015 -> 2020
  - Gen plot of EF2+ tornado reports by geolocation
  - Find specific geo-footprints of interest (Great Plains, Dixie Alley)
  - For each geo-footprint, find specific times of year depending on climatology
    - Gen plots of reports vs. time of year for both locations
    - Central plains -> Apr 15 -> June 15
    - Dixie Alley -> Feb 15 -> Apr 15
  - Find all EF-2 tornado reports within geo-area
    - Download 12Z, 18Z, 00Z HRRR analysis products for that day
    - Determine aggregate parameters to look at for that area
      - TODO
      - Could PCA help here?
    - Need for negative samples? Random samples from same area on same day in non-tornado years.
    - Find correlations to tornado reports (params with low variance, bi-modal, tri-model, etc, etc)
      - This is the majority of the project
  - Train model based on observations we find most convincing, perhaps as early as 12Z
    - Decision trees?
    - SVM classifier?
    - Simple neural network classifier?
    - Gen ROC curve?
    - Perform on holdout set -> 2021 reports
