NWSTools plan:
- Fetch SPC threats and forecasts
- Parse NWS point forecasts (take from WWS)
- Parse curent NWS alerts (take from WWS)
- Fetch GOES-R imagery
- Fetch weather radar

Data Mining Project:
  - For years 2015 -> 2020
  - Gen plot of EF2+ tornado reports by geolocation
  - Find specific geo-footprints of interest (Great Plains, Dixie Alley, Midwest)
    - Great Plains: (31, -102) -> (43, -94.5)
    - Dixie Alley: (29, -94.5) -> (36.5, -82)
    - Midwest: (36.5, -94.5) -> (43, -82)

  - For each geo-footprint, find specific times of year depending on climatology
    - Gen plots of reports vs. time of year for both locations
    - Determined:
      - Great Plains: Apr 1 -> Jun 1
      - Dixie Alley: Mar 1 -> May 1
      - Midwest: Feb 15 -> Apr 15

  - For each region, determine positive and negative sample days
    - Sample includes: date, center point
    - Group by region and time (cluster by radius)
    - Positive
    - Negative

  - Find all EF-2 tornado reports within geo-area
    - Download 12Z, 18Z, 00Z HRRR analysis products for that day
    - Determine aggregate parameters to look at for that area
      - TODO
      - Could PCA help here?
    - Need for negative samples? Random samples from same area on same day in non-tornado years.
    - Find correlations to tornado reports (params with low variance, bi-modal, tri-model, etc, etc)
      - This is the majority of the project

  - Train model based on observations we find most convincing, perhaps as early as 12Z
    - Decision trees?
    - SVM classifier?
    - Simple neural network classifier?
    - Gen ROC curve?
    - Perform on holdout set -> 2021 reports
